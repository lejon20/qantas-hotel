## Getting started

Run the following commands (classic) to run the server:

- `npm install`
- `npm start`

Or the following to run the tests:

- `npm test`


## Overall comment

I have gone with the Smart and Dumb Component approach, where HotelList is the only smart component.

Because I ran out of time I DID NOT:
- implement half rating
- write more tests
- Finish the UI
- build a web server & use ajax to fetch the data
